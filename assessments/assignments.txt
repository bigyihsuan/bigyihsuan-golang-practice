1. sum is a function which takes a slice of numbers
and adds them together. What would its function
signature look like in Go?
2. Write a function which takes an integer and
halves it and returns true if it was even or false
if it was odd. For example half(1) should return
(0, false) and half(2) should return (1,
true).
3. Write a function with one variadic parameter
that finds the greatest number in a list of numbers.
4. Using makeEvenGenerator as an example, write a
makeOddGenerator function that generates odd
numbers.
5. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as: fib(0) =
0, fib(1) = 1, fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).
Write a recursive function which can find
fib(n).
