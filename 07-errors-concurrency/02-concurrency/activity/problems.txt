1) Create a slice of 20 of type int and take 20 number
    create 4 goroutines to take average of every 5 elements
    ex[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20] ,
    so 1 goroutine should give average of first 5 elements and next for another 5 so on

2) Take a Paragraphs of text Max word 
    up to 200 words in a Slice or String
    and then Pass each  Sentence(up to full stop) to another go routine/routines 
        a) print it in reverse order(1 goroutine)
        b) count its words(2 goroutine)

3) Create a goroutine/channels to send and receive structure data type
    free to design for any purpose
